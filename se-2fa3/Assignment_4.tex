Assignment 4 consists of two problems.  You must write your solutions
to the problems using LaTeX.

Please submit Assignment~4 as two files,
\texttt{Assignment\_4\_\emph{YourMacID}.tex} and
\texttt{Assignment\_4\_\emph{YourMacID}.pdf}, to the Assignment~4
folder on Avenue under Assessments/Assignments.
\texttt{\emph{YourMacID}} must be your personal MacID (written without
capitalization).  The \texttt{Assignment\_4\_\emph{YourMacID}.tex}
file is a copy of the LaTeX source file for this assignment
(\texttt{Assignment\_4.tex} found on Avenue under
Contents/Assignments) with your solution entered after each problem.
The \texttt{Assignment\_4\_\emph{YourMacID}.pdf} is the PDF output
produced by executing

\begin{itemize}

  \item[] \texttt{pdflatex Assignment\_4\_\emph{YourMacID}}

\end{itemize}

This assignment is due \textbf{Sunday, February 28, 2021 before
  midnight.}  You are allow to submit the assignment multiple times,
but only the last submission will be marked.  \textbf{Late submissions
  and files that are not named exactly as specified above will not be
  accepted!}  It is suggested that you submit your preliminary
\texttt{Assignment\_4\_\emph{YourMacID}.tex} and
\texttt{Assignment\_4\_\emph{YourMacID}.pdf} files well before the
deadline so that your mark is not zero if, e.g., your computer fails
at 11:50 PM on February 28.

\textbf{Although you are allowed to receive help from the
  instructional staff and other students, your submission must be your
  own work.  Copying will be treated as academic dishonesty! If any of
  the ideas used in your submission were obtained from other students
  or sources outside of the lectures and tutorials, you must
  acknowledge where or from whom these ideas were obtained.}

\subsection*{Presenting DFAs and NFAs Transition Diagrams}

In this assignment you are asked to present DFAs as transition
diagrams.  You are can do this in one of two ways.

The first way is to present the diagram using the LaTeX graphics
package TikZ.  The TikZ code can either be written by hand or
automatically generated using the finsm system available at
\texttt{http:finsm.io}.

Here are some examples of how it can be used to create
DFA and NFA transition diagrams that appear in the lectures slides:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=2.5cm,on grid,auto] 
   \node[state, initial, thick] (q_0)   {$q_0$}; 
   \node[state, thick] (q_1) [right=of q_0] {$q_1$}; 
   \node[state, thick] (q_2) [right=of q_1] {$q_2$}; 
   \node[state, accepting, thick] (q_3) [right=of q_2] {$q_3$};
    \path[->, thick, >=stealth] 
    (q_0) edge [bend left, above] node {$a$} (q_1)
          edge [loop, above] node {$b$} (q_2)
    (q_1) edge [bend left, above] node {$a$} (q_2)
          edge [bend left, above] node {$b$} (q_0)
    (q_2) edge [bend left, above] node {$a$} (q_3) 
          edge [bend left, below]  node {$b$} (q_0)
    (q_3) edge [loop, above] node {$a,b$} (q_2); 
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

   \node[state, thick] (q_2) [below=of q_0] {$q_2$}; 
   \node[state, thick] (q_3) [right=of q_2] {$q_3$};
    \path[->, thick, >=stealth] 
    (q_0) edge [bend left, above] node {1} (q_1)
          edge [bend left, right] node {0} (q_2)

          edge [bend left, left]  node {0} (q_0)
    (q_3) edge [bend left, below] node {1} (q_2) 
          edge [bend left, left]  node {0} (q_1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=1.7cm,on grid,auto] 
   \node[state, initial, thick] (q_0)   {$q_0$}; 
   \node[state, thick] (q_1) [right=of q_0] {$q_1$}; 
   \node[state, thick] (q_2) [right=of q_1] {$q_2$}; 
   \node[state, thick] (q_3) [right=of q_2] {$q_3$};
   \node[state, thick] (q_4) [right=of q_3] {$q_4$};
   \node[state, thick, accepting] (q_5) [right=of q_4] {$q_5$};
    \path[->, thick, >=stealth]

          edge [right, above] node {1} (q_1)
    (q_1) edge [right, above] node {0,1} (q_2)
    (q_2) edge [right, above] node {0,1} (q_3)
    (q_3) edge [right, above] node {0,1} (q_4)
    (q_4) edge [right, above] node {0,1} (q_5);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The second way is to take a picture of a hand-written transition
diagram and then embed it into your assignment using the following
LaTeX code:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{diagram.jpg}
\end{center}
\end{verbatim}
Please make sure your diagram is legible.

   \textbf{Aamina Hussain, hussaa54, February 28, 2021}\\
   
   \emph{Proof.} Let $L(B) = \{w \in \{0, 1\}^* | w$ ends with an odd number of $1s\}$. Then I need to show that $w \in \Sigma^*$ is $w \in L(B)$ if it ends in an odd number of 1s, or $w \notin L(B)$ if it does not end in an odd number of 1s.\\
   
   $P_1 \equiv$ if $\delta^*(q_0, w) = q_0 \implies w = \epsilon \lor w$ ends in a 0 $(w \notin L(B))$\\
   $P_2 \equiv$ if $\delta^*(q_0, w) = q_1 \implies w$ ends in an odd number of 1s $(w \in L(B))$\\
   $P_3 \equiv$ if $\delta^*(q_0, w) = q_2 \implies w$ ends in an even number of 1s $(w \notin L(B))$\\

   Let $|w| = n$ be the length of our input string $w$. We will prove $P_1, P_2$, and $P_3$ hold by weak induction on the length of our input string $w$. $P(n)$ holds if $P_1, p_2$, and $P_3$ hold.

    \emph{Base Case ($P_1$)} $|w| = n = 0$, $w = \epsilon$
    \begin{align*}
      &\phantom{{}=} \delta(q_0, w) & \pnote{LHS of $P_1$}\\
      &= \delta(q_0, \epsilon) \\
      &= q_0       & \pnote{def. of $\delta^*$}\\
    \end{align*}
    This is trivially obvious by the definition of $\delta^*$ since $w = \epsilon$.\\
    So, $P_1$ holds for $w = \epsilon$.

    \emph{Base Case ($P_2$)} $|w| = n = 0$, $w = \epsilon$
    \begin{align*}
      &\phantom{{}=} \delta(q_0, w) & \pnote{LHS of $P_2$}\\
      &= \delta(q_0, \epsilon) \\
      &= q_0       & \pnote{def. of $\delta^*$}\\
      &\equiv False       & \pnote{$q_0 \neq q_1$}\\
    \end{align*}
    Since the LHS of the implication is false (i.e., $\epsilon$ does not end with an odd number of 1s; $False \implies x \equiv True$), and $q_0 \neq q_1$, we can conclude $P_2$ is true and therefore holds for $w = \epsilon$.

    \emph{Base Case ($P_3$)} $|w| = n = 0$, $w = \epsilon$
    \begin{align*}
      &\phantom{{}=} \delta(q_0, w) & \pnote{LHS of $P_3$}\\
      &= \delta(q_0, \epsilon) \\
      &= q_0       & \pnote{def. of $\delta^*$}\\
      &\equiv False       & \pnote{$q_0 \neq q_2$}\\
    \end{align*}
    Since the LHS of the implication is false (i.e., $\epsilon$ does not end with an even number of 1s; $False \implies x \equiv True$), and $q_0 \neq q_2$, we can conclude $P_3$ is true and therefore holds for $w = \epsilon$.

    \emph{Induction Step}: Let $n = |w| > 0$. Let $w = xi$, where $x \in \Sigma^*$ and $i \in \Sigma$. Let $n = |x|$. Assume $P(n)$ holds. $|w| = n+1$, so prove $P(n+1)$ holds.

    \emph{Induction Step ($P_1$)}:
    \begin{align*}
      &\phantom{{}=} \delta^*(q_0, w) & \pnote{LHS of $P_1$}\\
      &= \delta^*(q_0, xi) & \pnote{let $w = xi$}\\
      &= \delta(\delta^*(q_0, x), i)      & \pnote{def. of $\delta^*$}\\
      &= q_0       & \pnote{def. of $\delta^*$; RHS}\\
    \end{align*}
    For all $\delta(q, 0)$ for $q \in Q$ in B. (According to DFA B, every state transitions to state $q_0$ using the input 0, and no state transitions to $q_0$ using the input 1.) Therefore, $i$ must be equal to 0 ($i=0$). This means that our string $w = xi = x0$ ends in a zero. Therefore, $P_1$ holds.

    \emph{Induction Step ($P_2$)}:
    \begin{align*}
      &\phantom{{}=} \delta^*(q_0, w) & \pnote{LHS of $P_2$}\\
      &= \delta^*(q_0, xi) & \pnote{let $w = xi$}\\
      &= \delta(\delta^*(q_0, x), i)      & \pnote{def. of $\delta^*$}\\
      &= q_1       & \pnote{def. of $\delta^*$; RHS}\\
    \end{align*}
    We know from DFA B that we have $\delta(q_0, 1) = q_1$ and $\delta(q_2, 1) = q_1$. There are two transitions that take us to $q_1$ using a 1. Therefore, $i = 1$ in both cases.\\
    \emph{Case 1} $\delta(q_0, 1) = q_1$: $i=1$ and $\delta^*(q_0, x) = q_0$. We can use our induction hypothesis, where $P(n+1)$ says that $P_1$ holds. Then $x = y0$ where $y \in \Sigma^*$. $w = xi = y01$, which ends in a single 1, which is an odd number of 1s.\\
    \emph{Case 2} $\delta(q_2, 1) = q_1$: $i=1$ and $\delta^*(q_0, x) = q_2$. We can use our induction hypothesis, where $P(n+1)$ says that $P_3$ holds. Then $x = y11$ where $y \in \Sigma^*$. $w = xi = y111$, which ends in three 1s, which is an odd number of 1s.

    Therefore, $P_2$ holds.

    \emph{Induction Step ($P_3$)}:
    \begin{align*}
      &\phantom{{}=} \delta^*(q_0, w) & \pnote{LHS of $P_3$}\\
      &= \delta^*(q_0, xi) & \pnote{let $w = xi$}\\
      &= \delta(\delta^*(q_0, x), i)      & \pnote{def. of $\delta^*$}\\
      &= q_2       & \pnote{def. of $\delta^*$; RHS}\\
    \end{align*}
    We know from DFA B that we have $\delta(q_1, 1) = q_2$, which means that $i = 1$. $\delta^*(q_0, x) = q_1$. We can use our induction hypothesis, where $P(n+1)$ says that $P_2$ holds. Then $x = y1$ where $y \in \Sigma^*$. $w = xi = y11$, which ends in a two 1s, which is an even number of 1s.

    Therefore, $P_3$ holds.

    $P_1, P_2$, and $P_3$ all hold. Therefore, $P(n)$ holds for all $n$ by weak induction.
